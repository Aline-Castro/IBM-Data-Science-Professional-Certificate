# Practice Quiz - Jupyter Notebooks and Jupyter Lab <br>

#### Question 1: What functionality is provided by the Jupyter Notebook file to Data Scientists? <br>

* Allows to code in only one language <br>
* Runs the code and generates the output in a separate file <br>
✔ ***Allows to combine descriptive text, code blocks, and code output in a single file***  <br>
* Does not allow to share the file in any format <br>

###### *Correct! A Jupyter Notebook file allows Data Scientists to combine descriptive text, code blocks, <br> and code output in a single file.* <br>


#### Question 2: What is the purpose of the kernel in the Jupyter Notebook?  <br>

* Writes the code <br>
* Translates the code to a different language <br>
* Exports the code to a different file <br>
✔ ***Executes the code***  <br>

###### *Correct! A notebook kernel is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a Notebook file.* <br>


#### Question 3: What are the elements of Jupyter’s architecture? <br>

* Two kernels and a server <br>
* Two clients and a server <br>
✔ ***Kernel and client***  <br>

###### *Correct! Jupyter implements a two-process model with a kernel and a client.* <br>


#### Question 4: What is the default kernel of JupyterLite? <br>

* SQLite <br>
* No kernel <br>
✔ ***Pyolite***  <br>
* Julia <br>

###### *Correct! The default kernel for JupyterLite is Pyolite.* <br>


#### Question 5: What is the purpose of Anaconda? <br>

* Allows to install packages using a command line interface only <br>
✔ ***Allows to install new packages without using a command line interface***  <br>
* Allows execution of code written in any language <br>
* Allows creating interactive visualizations <br>

###### *Correct! The downloadable Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface allows users to install new packages <br> on their local device without using a command line interface.*
