# Graded Quiz: From Requirements to Collection

#### Question 1: In the context of data science methodology, select the answer that describes what happens during the Data Requirements stage. 

* Selecting the programming language for analysis <br>
* Organizing data into columns and rows <br>
✔ ***Identifying the necessary data content, formats, and sources ***<br>
* Defining the ingredients needed for a meal <br>


#### Question 2: What technique can you apply to the data set during the data collection stage to assess data content, quality, and initial insights? 

✔ ***Data visualization and descriptive statistics ***<br>
* Predictive model <br>
* Data preparation <br>
* Data extraction and merging <br>

#### Question 3: Imagine you are a data scientist working on a healthcare project. Your task is to define the data requirements for a decision tree classification approach to predict patient readmission rates.  
Select the answer that describes the purpose of defining data requirements in the context of the healthcare project.  

* To select the appropriate patients for the cohort <br>
* To identify the best programming language for analysis <br>
✔ ***To identify the necessary data content, formats, and source ***<br>
* To determine the total budget for the project <br>

#### Question 4: You are a data scientist tasked with collecting and preparing data for a predictive modelling project related to patient outcomes. You have encountered some data sources, mainly drug information, that are missing. How would you handle this situation? 
What is a suitable approach when encountering missing data sources in the data collection process context? 

* Exclude the entire patient cohort from the analysis. <br>
* Proceed with incomplete data and hope for accurate results. <br>
✔ ***Attempt to acquire the missing data after obtaining intermediate results. ***<br>
* Discard the project and start over with a different methodology. <br>

#### Question 5:  Which stage of the methodology involves collaborating with DBAs and programmers to extract and merge data from various sources?

* Data Preparation <br>
* Data Understanding <br>
✔ ***Data Collection***<br>
* Data Requirements <br>
